          "From the UC Davis School of Medicine: “The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recently issued an alert about reports of canine dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) in dogs eating certain pet foods containing peas, lentils, other legume seeds, or potatoes as main ingredients. DCM is a disease of the heart muscle that leads to reduced heart pumping function and increased heart size. The alterations in heart function and structure can result in severe consequences such as congestive heart failure or sudden cardiac death. While the most common cause of DCM is genetic, on rare occasions other factors can also result in the condition, particularly in breeds that are not frequently affected.”",

          "Maybe not. Pistachios aren’t inherently toxic to dogs, but nuts aren’t a recommended treat for our furry friends. They’re high in fat and can contain a mold that puts your dog at risk for liver damage. Nuts can also give your dog an upset stomach or cause an intestinal obstruction leading to more serious digestive issues. In addition, pistachio shells are a choking hazard.",

          "We all know that dogs can eat coconut oil, and owners are often encouraged to add it to their dogs’ diets, but what about the coconut meat itself? Should we be giving actual pieces of it to our dogs? The short answer is yes! Coconut meat is just as healthy, if not more so, than the coconut oil alone. They share similar properties since they come from the same place. Coconut is non-toxic to dogs, but it does contain medium chain triglycerides, which may cause some gastrointestinal upset and bloating. You’ll want to check with your veterinarian before giving your dog coconut, of course. But the benefits should certainly outweigh the risks. So if your dog likes the taste of coconut meat, feel free to give him some.",

Well, first of all, you shouldn’t ever give your pooch coconut in its shell, as eating pieces of coconut shell can be very dangerous for dogs since they can cause an intestinal obstruction. While you may think that the hard shell might be a good natural dental treat for your pooch to chew on, the truth is that this is the one part of the coconut your four-legged companion should definitely steer clear of.",
